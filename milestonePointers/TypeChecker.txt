The source code for our program is located in SRC/ Driver and src/parse
TypeCheckerDriver checks one program for errors and TypeCheckerDriverAll runs all tests
The output is placed into input_output/TypeCheckerGneratedTests

our error that we print don't always align with some of the test
cases because the way we treat invalid declarations is different
in some case, like we throw out a bad method override and then 
throw errors inside the method because we use the main method
However if a test cases has at least one error in it we will have
at least one error in it.
