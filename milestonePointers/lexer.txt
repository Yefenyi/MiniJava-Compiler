The source code for the lexer portion of this project is located in the src/lex package under FullLexerDriver.java
We used antlr to generate our lexical parser
The antlr generated components should be found in the src/antlr4 package
the inputs we used to test things are found in the input_output folder which containts 4 input examples and 
	then the corresponding lexical outputs.
