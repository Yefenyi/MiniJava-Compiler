Our parser main is located at  src/driver/FullParserDriver.java
the input file is specified by the first arg in the command line

the out put is in the following form
->if errors exist they are output first
->flat parse tree
->number of errors

Because the flat parse tree is quite ugly we have a graphical interface to display the 
parse tree, it even highlights the errors in the file

so we don't have any output.txt files for this milestone because most of the information 
is contained in the graphic window, if you cannot get the code to run, let us know and 
we can demo it
