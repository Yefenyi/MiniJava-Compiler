To test our code generator we have a tester in test/lex called FullCodeGeneratorTest.java. Running this 
file will run our code generator and create testAsmOutTestCase##_##.asm which is then run in by the mars.jar
located in the root directory. The output of running the assembly files is placed written to 
asmFileOutputTestCase##_##.out_gen which is then compared against the expexcted output. You can manually run 
the asm files by running the mars.jar file to verify the test case.

Our code for this is all located in src/codeGenerator
