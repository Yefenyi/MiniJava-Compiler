Our compiler is targeting the MIPS architecture, in part because we both have used the hardware before. 
The simulator we are using is the MARS MIPS simulator. Its a very nice simulator that can be found in 
the MiniJavaCompiler project as mars.jar. This is simulator is has about 155 psudeo instrunctions and 
and about 20 syscalls that can be called like functions, which is how we implement system print 

Our code is in src/driver codeGneratorDriver.java
it prints out the list of instructions in the console that can be directly used in the simulator

currently we can only do small programs that only use main right now
